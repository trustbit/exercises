# ML Ops on Mars

This is a set of software exercises in the domain of ML Ops (Machine Learning Operations). They take place on Mars.

We plan for ~3-4 exercises in this set.

- Exercise 1: [I heard you know programming...](exercise1.md)
- Exercise 2: [We lost one rover](exrcise2.md)
- Exercise 3: Overheating problem (to be announced)



Please feel free to complete exercises and send PRs that add links to your own solutions. There will be a "Solutions" section at the end of each exercise exactly for that. 

Should you have any questions, feel free to discuss them in the [MLOps Slack](https://go.mlops.community/slack). You could mention `@abdullin` to get a faster response from us, if needed.


Welcome to Mars!
