# Katas for DDD, Data Science and ML

This is a set of small software katas (exercises). They help to improve software skills without spending too much time.

Katas are designed to gently introduce software engineers to the concepts:

- logistics domain (cargo transportation)
- Domain-Driven Design
- Machine Learning and Data Science

It is better to do all katas in order, since they are designed for a soft progression.

## How to get started?

1. Check out the [first exercise](https://github.com/Softwarepark/exercises/blob/master/transport-tycoon_21.md) of the current season (find the shortest path on the map).
2. Write a small code snippet that solves the problem.
3. [Contribute](https://github.com/Softwarepark/exercises/blob/master/transport-tycoon/README.md) your solution and check out the solutions of the others.
4. Go for the next exercise.
